# (Class) [Spree::Prototype](http://m.gymplayer.com/prototype.rb)
* A Product template to quickly add new products that differ *only* in`OptionType` and or `Property`
* A way to share `OptionType` and `Property` combinations amongst different products. For instance,
if you're creating lots of shirt products, you may wish to maintain "Size" and "Color" option
types as well as a "Fitting Type" property
