# (Class) [Spree::TaxRate](http://m.gymplayer.com/tax_rate.rb)
* A zone might have multiple `tax_rates`
* Taxes will be calculated based on best matching zone for the order
* When an order is placed, any product with a tax zone matching the order's zone will be taxed

Tax rates can *potentially* be applicable to an order but this can't be determined until we 
attempt to apply these rates to the order's items. For instance, if a rate 
passes the criteria outlined in this method, but then has a tax category that doesn't match against any 
of the line items inside of the order, then that tax rate will not be applicable to anything

##### *Example*

* Spain (default tax zone)
* France


| Tax Rate | Type      | Category | Country |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 21%      | inclusive | Clothing | Spain   |
| 18%      | inclusive | Clothing | France  |
| 10%      | inclusive | Food     | Spain   |
| 8%       | inclusive | Food     | France  |
| 5%       | inclusive | Hotels   | Spain   |
| 2%       | inclusive | Hotels   | France  |

If an order had 2 line items, one from Clothing  category and the other from Food category, the tax rates that should be selected:

| Tax Rate | Type      | Category | Country |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 21%      | inclusive | Clothing | Spain   |
| 10%      | inclusive | Food     | Spain   |

If the order's address changes to one in France, then the tax will be recalculated:

| Tax Rate | Type      | Category | Country |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 18%      | inclusive | Clothing | France  |
| 8%       | inclusive | Food     | France  |

* Under no circumstances should negative adjustments be applied for the Spanish tax rates
* Those rates should never come into play at all and only the French rates should apply

#### Attributes

* `tax_category_id`: Tax category a product must belong to to be taxable
* `included_in_price`: Whether product prices are inclusive of this tax
* `name`
* `show_rate_in_label`
* `deleted_at`
