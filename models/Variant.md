# (Class) [Spree::Variant](http://m.gymplayer.com/variant.rb)
> Variant is also document under [Product Guide](../../Products)

* A variant tracks a group of individual properties (Option Types) of a `Product` such as height,
 width, depth, and cost price
* These properties are unique to each variant and so are on top of `Product Properties` that apply
 to all variants of a product
* All variants can access the product properties directly (via reverse delegation)
* Inventory units are tied to Variant. Other variants have option values and may have inventory units
* Sum of `on_hand` each variant's inventory level determine `on_hand` level for the product
* `sku` field holds product's stock code

#### Example
Variants: "Small, Red", "Small, Green", "Small, Blue", "Medium, Red", "Medium, Green"...

### Normal Variants
All non-master variants are  based on `option_type` and `option_value` combinations

#### Attributes
* `sku`
* `weight`
* `height`
* `width`
* `depth`
* `deleted_at`
* `is_master`
* `product_id`
* `cost_price`
* `cost_currency`
* `position`
* `track_inventory`
* `tax_category_id`
* `stock_items_count`

### (Object) **price_modifier_amount**(options = {})


### (Object) **price_modifier_amount_in**(currency, options = {})
