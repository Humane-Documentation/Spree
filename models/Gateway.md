## Adding a gateway (Customization)
For a custom gateway to show up on the backend you need to add it to the config list of payment
methods by adding the following in spree.rb for example:
```
Rails.application.config.spree.payment_methods << YourCustomGateway
```

## Typical Fees (TMI)
* *Setup Fee* - A one-time charge to set up a payment gateway account
* *Recurring Fixed Monthly Fees* - fixed monthly fee gateway provider charges for access to 
their services and reports. Some gateways break this charge down further into a monthly
Gateway Fee and a Statement Fee
* *Transaction Fees* - A charge for each purchase made on your store. Pricing structure for 
these differ but a popular structure is to charge a percentage of the purchase price plus a flat fee
