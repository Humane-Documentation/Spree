shipped in the same box. e.g. "Default", "Over-sized"..
* During checkout, shipping categories of products determine which calculator will
be used to price each Shipping Method
* Can be created in the admin interface ("Configuration" -> "Shipping Categories") and then
assigned to products ("Products" -> "Edit")
